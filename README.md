## Usage
For basic applications using a restful architecture, ducktrails should generate the breadcrumbs automatically.

For example, if the uri is `/users/#{user-id}/posts/#{post-id}`
Putting `<%= breadcrumbs %>` in the (erb) view.

Would render:

`Home / All Users / user-name / All Posts / post-name`

Simply include `= breadcrumbs` in your view. `breadcrumbs` takes a block argument.  The block isn't required but if you want to set some objects for the uri resources (recommend) you can follow the guide below.

Resources are inferred and will be used to manipulate each URI segment. If a resource is not found, Ducktrails will fallback to the URI.

Possible keys for a breadcrumb resource are: `resource, key, policy, collection_prefix`. The key and collection prefix can be configured in the `Ducktrails.rb` initializer described below.

```erb
<%=breadcrumbs do
    {
      users: {
        resource: @user,
        key: :first_name,
        collection_prefix: 'Some'
      }
    }
  end
%>
```

Will output

Action | Breadcrumb
---|---
index |`Home / Some Users`
show |`Home / Some Users / Kevin`
new |`Home / Some Users / New`
edit |`Home /Some Users / Kevin / edit`
