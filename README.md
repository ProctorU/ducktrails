## Usage
For basic applications using a restful architecture, ducktrails should generate the breadcrumbs automatically.

For example, if the uri is `/users/#{user-id}/posts/#{post-id}`

Would render:

`Home / All Users / user-name / All Posts / post-name`

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ducktrails'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install ducktrails
```
